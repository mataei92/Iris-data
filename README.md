# Iris-data
In this project the Iris dataset (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Iris/) is used to build and train a k-nearest-neighbor (kNN) classifier to accurately predict the Iris type. 
The data set consists of 50 samples from each of three species of Iris (Iris Setosa, Iris virginica, and Iris versicolor). Four features were measured from each sample: the length and the width of the sepals and petals, in centimeters. The model is trained with different number of K values and sheds light on the best value of the K for training the model to accurately predict the Iris class.
